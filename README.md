Dumbed-down implementations of design patterns in TypeScript. Some are inspired from [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do).

To run the sample code from an indiviual implementation, first `npm install` and then run against pattern design name: `npm run <directory-name>`. 

E.g.
```bash
npm run observer
```
